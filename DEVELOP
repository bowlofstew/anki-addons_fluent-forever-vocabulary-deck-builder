==================================================

#Setup working environment

1. Download anki from git
2. Rename runanky to runanky.py
3. In runanki.py change the line sys.path.insert(0, "/usr/share/anki") to sys.path.insert(0, "./anki")
4. Assume . is anki master folder. In ./anki there may be a file anky.py with only comments. Remove this file
   because it is imported in place of the module (__init__.py) causing errors.

   To debug it:

       import sys
       sys.path.insert(0, "./anki")
       print anki.__file__

   you should get

       anki/__init__.pyc

#Setup KDevelop

Create a launch script:

    Interpreter: python (or python2) #Anki only supports python2
    Always run the same file: (Point to runanki.py)

#Know problems of KDevelop

    * If we print something in the code, we can actually see the output on the shell online when the main executable is closed.
      So we don't see the output realtime, which is extremely annoying.
